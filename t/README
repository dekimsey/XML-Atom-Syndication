This are some notes and possible additions about these
tests.

The example Atom files used in these tests where acquired
from http://feedparser.org/tests/wellformed/atom10/ on Jan
29 2006. Supplimental example files were added. These files
are prefixed with 'x-'. Not all files are used as some were
no applicable to the scope and interface of this package. In
general the following were NOT tested:

* No mappings.
* Relative links. 
* ID normalization.

Also Atom 0.3 elements that have been deprecated are not
tested.

Some deeper tests of the source element and Writer module
output are probably needed.
