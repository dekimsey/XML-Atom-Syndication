=head1 DESCRIPTION

XML::Atom::Syndication::Entry element represents an
individual Atom entry that acts as a container for metadata
and data associated with the entry. This element can appear
as a child of a feed element represented by
L<XML::Atom::Syndication::Feed>, or it can appear as the
document (i.e., top-level) element of a standalone Atom
Entry Document.

=head1 METHODS

XML::Atom::Syndication::Entry is a subclass of
L<XML::Atom::Syndication::Object> (via
L<XML::Atom::Syndication:::Thing>) that it inherits numerous
methods from. You should already be familiar with this base
class before proceeding.
