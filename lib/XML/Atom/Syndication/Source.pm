=head1 NAME

XML::Atom::Syndication::Source - class representing an Atom
source element

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If an Atom entry is copied from one feed into another feed,
then the source atom:feed's metadata (all child elements of
atom:feed other than the atom:entry elements) MAY be
preserved within the copied entry by adding an atom:source
child element, if it is not already present in the entry,
and including some or all of the source feed's Metadata
elements as the atom:source element's children. Such
metadata SHOULD be preserved if the source atom:feed
contains any of the child elements atom:author,
atom:contributor, atom:rights, or atom:category and those
child elements are not present in the source atom:entry.

The source element is designed to allow the aggregation
of entries from different feeds while retaining information
about an entry's source feed. For this reason, Atom
Processors which are performing such aggregation SHOULD
include at least the required feed-level Metadata elements
(id, title, and updated) in the source element.

Essentially the source element contains any or all of the
elements that can be found in a feed element except for
published and atom entry elements.

=head1 METHODS

L<XML::Atom::Syndication:::Object> that it inherits a number of
methods from. You should already be familar with this base
class before proceeding.

Indicates the author of the source feed.

This accessor returns a <XML::Atom::Syndication::Person>

reference or by passing in an object. See Working with
Object Setters in L<XML::Atom::Syndication::Object> for more
detail.

=item category

Conveys information about a category associated with a source feed.

This accessor returns a <XML::Atom::Syndication::Category>
object. This element can be set using a string and hash
reference or by passing in an object. See Working with
Object Setters in L<XML::Atom::Syndication::Object> for more
detail.

=item contributor

Indicates a person or other entity who contributed to the
source feed.

This accessor returns a <XML::Atom::Syndication::Person>

reference or by passing in an object. See Working with
Object Setters in L<XML::Atom::Syndication::Object> for more
detail.

=item generator

Identifies the agent used to generate a source feed for debugging
and other purposes. 

This accessor returns a <XML::Atom::Syndication::Generator>
object. This element can be set using a string and hash
reference or by passing in an object. See Working with
Object Setters in L<XML::Atom::Syndication::Object> for more
