=head1 NAME

XML::Atom::Syndication - a portable client for 
consuming RFC 4287 Atom Syndication Feeds.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This project is the result of scratching ones own itch. I
was writing some web software needed a full-featured library
for working with Atom feeds that was easy to distribute and
install on wide range of environments. Many of my software's
target audience are relative novices working with low-cost
shared hosting environments. (A significant number don't
even have shell access!) Creating a library that was easy to
install even by FTP was a paramount requirement that many
other options failed to meet.

Originally the module began as a very spartan XPath driven
interface. At the time the format had just been introduced
and was still vague and very extremely volatile. It was a
pretty wretched piece of software, but it got me through
while the Atom Working Group worked out the details of the
Atom Syndication Format.

Since that time the Atom Syndication Format (ASF) has made
its way through numerous drafts and is now an approved
standard of the IETF as RFC 4287.

Beginning with version 0.9, XML::Atom::Syndication has been
completely rewritten to provide better functionality and
structure in working with a stable Atom format
specification.

The interface and a fair bit of the code was based on that
of L<XML::Atom>. It owes a great deal to its authors, Ben
Trott and Tatsuhiko Miyagawa, and all its contributors.

As of version 0.16, XML::Atom defaults to version 0.3 which
is now deprecated.  Baseline 1.0 support has been built-in
however many of the changes that were introduced (category
elements, dropping the mode attribute in the content
construct) have yet to be implemented. I'm sure this will
change eventually, but it currently is a differentiator
between the two implementations. XML::Atom::Syndication
supports 0.3, but defaults 1.0.

More importantly this implementation is not tied to specific
XML parsers -- XML::LibXML or XML::XPath (expat) as is the
case with XML::Atom. Both of these parsers libraries require
compilation  which can be a major hurdle if you are not in
charge of your hosting environment. By using SAX at the
core, this Atom implementation will work with whatever
parser it can find including the default pure perl option
that XML::SAX is distributed with.

Unlike XML::Atom, this distribution focuses on the Atom
syndication format and not the publishing protocol. The
publishing protocol is still being worked out and is not an
official standard at this time.

=head2 ENCODING

Perl has a spotty history of supporting international
character sets prior to version 5.8.1. All caveats and
cautions apply when using this package with character sets
other then ASCII with versions of Perl before that time.

When used with Perl 5.8.1 and higher XML::Atom::Syndication
will look for the encoding in the XML declaration and
convert it to UTF-8 right before parsing. This simplifies
further processing a great deal. Perl 5.8+ uses UTF-8
internally and numerous other modules (such as
L<XML::Writer>) will only work with UTF-8 encoded content.

I found this also has the added benefit of making this
package more portable. Perl's built-in encoding converters
are more extensive then what typically ships with the
standard parser. By converting to UTF-8 using Perl's system
before parsing the potential for an encoding module
dependency is eliminated. All XML parsers must support
UTF-8.

All output using L<XML::Atom::Syndication::Writer> will be
in UTF-8 regardless of the original encoding before parsing.
